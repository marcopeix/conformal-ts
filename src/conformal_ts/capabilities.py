"""
Capability mixins for forecaster adapters.

Each mixin declares one optional capability via an abstract method. Adapters
inherit from the mixins they implement; conformal methods declare which mixins
they require via `REQUIRED_CAPABILITIES`.

Inheriting from a mixin without overriding its method is a programming error
caught at adapter import time (the abstract method makes the class
uninstantiable).
